How to use Git

Go to your ece555/cadence/ECE_555 directory

Make a backup of everything in this folder and put it somewhere else so the folder is empty

From that backup folder you just made, drag the cdsinfo.tag and tech.db files back into the ECE_555 directory

Open up a terminal in the ECE_555 directory

Type these (with enter following each line):

git init

git remote add origin https://github.com/cdlast/ECE555CremeDream.git





Every time after the first entry (Don't include the parentheses)  <-------------

git add (any files/folders you want to add to the repo)
EX: git add README.txt

git commit -m "Commit message in quotes"







How to git pull:

git pull origin master
